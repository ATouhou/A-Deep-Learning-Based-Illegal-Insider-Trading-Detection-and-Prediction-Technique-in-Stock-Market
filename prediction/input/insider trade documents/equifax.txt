Even though Equifax executives have shown incompetence and foot-dragging in protecting sensitive data, it is unlikely anyone will face criminal charges. Probably no one is surprised? Considering not many corporate executives face harsh legal consequences for their mismanagement conducts. Therein lies the problem. Equifax executives who sold their stocks, after the intrusion but before the public announcement, may face insider stock trading charges, but will probably escape severe consequences for their recklessness in executing their fiduciary responsibilities which resulted in damages to millions of customers. They may also face compensation clawbacks, without possibly any criminal charges. Fines and clawbacks with no serious legal consequences serve as mere condemnation and not as a deterrence to inhibit recurring bad executive behavior
